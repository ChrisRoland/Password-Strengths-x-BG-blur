# Password Strength x Background Blur

![project image](image.png)

A creative and interactive web application that visually represents password strength using a dynamic background blur effect. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates how to provide real-time feedback to users in an engaging and intuitive way. The stronger the password, the clearer the background becomes!

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Background Blur**: The blur effect decreases as the password length increases, providing real-time feedback.
- **Interactive Design**: Input fields for email and password with a visually appealing, user-friendly interface.
- **Responsive UI**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes.
- **Modern Aesthetic**: Styled with TailwindCSS and custom CSS for a polished, modern look.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (with TailwindCSS integration).
- **JavaScript**: Handles dynamic blur effect and real-time password strength indication.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
